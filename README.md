some cool tools for manipulating airfoil data yo
The main point is to generate data that can be used with the curve fitting tool in solidworks and possibly other cad software for designing airfoils.

makefoil.py allows you to generate your own custom airfoil curve data with a few key inputs using some awesome NACA airfoil math.
the fromData dir holds two programs for scaling, fixing, and rewriting previously written data
